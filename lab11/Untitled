 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;

 /* Critical thinking questions
 *   1: The program says "HelloWorld!"
 *   2: The program starts, initializes main, and outputs the statment
 *   3: We put a space before World within the Quotations to give the output a white space.
 *   4: We can swap the word " World!" to " [name]!"
